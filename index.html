 <p><a href="https:// https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard makeup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.<img src="car.jpg" width="300">
</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.
</p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
